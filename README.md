These two papers compromise a hazy vision for an area of interest of mine in computer science research. The ideas are based in observations I've made while working as an engineer.

Early on I would try to formalize ideas like this in my free time although I quickly realized doing so is the work of full time academics and too complex and large in scope to be able to be done in nights and weekends. I left them here as I think they could be of value as a topic of research in some fashion, may be interesting to other engineers, and could be interesting to draw on later in life should I ever get the opportunity to do research.
